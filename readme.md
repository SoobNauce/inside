# Inside

## Dedication

Special thanks to copygirl for helping out with organizing the ideas.

## Core concept

_inside (vb. never capitalized) - To enter an object with the purpose of modifying it.

> "You should _inside that grue, and reduce its accuracy."

Conjugates like "Go in to", as in "Go in to that monster." ("_inside that monster."), or "Did you go in to your sword yet?" ("Did you _inside your sword yet?").

### What kind of things can you _inside to, and what can you accomplish once there?

Monsters!

* You can weaken their stats!
* You can learn their abilities!
* You can steal their soul and destabilize them! (Results may vary and soulstones are used for many purposes.)
* Maybe later, you can gain the ability to summon them.

Soulstones!

* You can enchant them!
* You can destabilize them (to turn them into Magic Powder)!
* They have a tier (based on monster level) and a level (based on how far you went into the monster before stealing their soul).

Weapons and armor!

* You can improve their stats!
* You can learn how to craft them!
* You can power them up with soulstones!
* You can even go back in to change the soulstones in them!
* You can even give them special abilities! (Gotta learn how to make them first.)
* You can level them up, unlocking new soulstone sockets!
* You can destabilize them (to turn them into Magic Powder)!

Spells!

* I don't know how you can go into a spell but you can!
* You can power them up (with soulstones)!
* You can just straight up level them up!
* You can't destabilize them though.
* You get Lancet for free, and you can upgrade it during the tutorial to turn it into _Lancet, which you use to _inside objects.

Floor tiles?!

* Yep! You can go into them too!
* You can increase their defensive stats!
* You can give them special abilities (yup, soulstones again)!
* You can even set them up to harm enemies!
* You can't destabilize them though, because what would they even turn into?

## Stuff that's done

* Make, display a player. (just the @ and the object, overview style)


## Near Roadmap

* Give the player a name.
* Describe the player.
  * Make the player generate a random letter name.
  * Make the player generate a random hex name.
* Make the map. (totally empty, outside box is impassable void)
  * Describe the map.
  * Put the player in the map.
  * Make wall tiles. Add them to the map. (player may walk into wall tiles...)
  * Make the player not walk into wall tiles.
* Give the map a DijkstraMap lookup table
  * Let the player DijkstraMap unexplored tiles.
* Move the player onscreen.
  * Add autoexplore.
* Add collision detection for wall tiles.
* Make a monster. Draw the monster.
  * Describe the monster.
* Make the monster chase the player. Stop moving if it would hit a wall.
* Make the monster pathfind to the player.
* Make the monster and the player take turns.
* Let the player _inside the monster. (its _inside is another arena with no monsters).
* Make the overworld be a dungeon.
* Make the monster's _inside be a dungeon.
